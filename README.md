#### The next three pictures compose a handwritten version of Michelle's wireframe.

My contributions to this readme are the first four pictures which portray a possible mockup of the chalkboard site. What I learned from this assignment is how to style a readme. I learned how to use markdown language and how to upload images to the github readme using instances. I also learned how to use a digital tool to create sitemaps and I have begun to understand how websites should flow together. Lastly, I also learned about wireframing. 
This concluded Michelle's portion. If any picture is unclear, please let Michelle know.

My contributions to this readme are also the first four pictures which portray a possible design of our chalkboard site. I learned many things from this assignment. I learned how to style a readme and how to host images on GitHub. I used the website Lucidchart to design my sitemap and learned more about wireframing. Ultimately, I was able to learn more how websites are put together and the planning that goes into it. 
This concludes Mez's portion
